                    <p>After finishing my graduation it seemed natural for me to continue studying and enroll in a master's degree, but by the end of the first semester I started to feel frustrated. It's very rewarding to grasp the knowledge you get from college, but after a few years it gets discouraging. I wanted more. More experience, more responsibility, more visibility. I felt it was time for me to learn by doing, working side by side with more experienced designers, in a professional environment.</p>

                        They don't tell you this in design college, but the reason you go to college is to learn how to learn. No design college can do much more than this.

                    <p>You never know if you're ready to do something until you start doing it. I never thought too much about it, but these two months were the period of time when I discovered more gaps in my knowledge. This wasn't by any means a bad thing, because the more mistakes I made the more I would improve. They never gave me solutions, they showed me how to get there by thinking about the problem from the ground up, defying every assumption I made and exploring as much as possible, never being satisfied with an "acceptable" iteration. They were, and still are, a team that supports me and helps me grow, by pushing me far beyond my known limits.</p>

                <p>Mobile web applications are expected to work differently from desktop applications. They need to feel responsive to the user's touch. Having worked on a couple of mobile web applications in the last year, I found that I always start by changing the browser's default appearance and behaviour. This article contains my setup to make a mobile web application feel more like a native one.</p>
